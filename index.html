               <h2>Dogs</h2>
               <p>Dogs have been considered to be man's best friend for centuries. The reason why these four legged hairy animals are 
               considered to be man's best friend is because they are very loyal to their owners. But dogs bring much more to 
               a person's life than just loyalty. Dogs can bring happiness to a family, protection and security, and emotional 
               support to those who needs it.

               <h2>Dogs Background</h2>
               <p>A lot of people love dogs, but they are shocked when they hear for the first time that dogs are decendants of wolves. 
                 Yes, that's right. According to multiple scientist, around 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, our ancestors started to domesticate 
                 wolves, which lead wolves to evolve. Their body shrank and their temperament changed. Thier skulls, paws and teeths
                 shrank, and they also started to be more docile and adjusted to human presence.</p>
